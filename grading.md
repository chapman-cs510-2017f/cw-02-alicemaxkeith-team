# Instructor comments

 - Watch spelling. You will be judged as a professional partly based on your ability to spell and format text cleanly and clearly.
 - Avoid stray files. You have two versions of a create files script with slightly different names. You also have a test file committed.
 - Watch your indenting. Consistency is key.
